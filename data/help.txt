=== DATABASE COMMANDS HELP ===

PWD - Password Management
  PWD SET <password>                       : Set a password for the file or database
  PWD EDIT <old_password> <new_password>   : Change password (use NONE to remove it)
  Note: Password is optional for files.

FILE - File Operations
  FILE LOAD <filename> [password]          : Load data from a .txt or .bin file
  FILE SAVE <filename> [password]          : Save current data to a file
  FILE DELETE <filename> [password]        : Delete a file
  FILE CONVERT <input> <output> [password] : Convert file format (.txt â†” .bin)
  Note: [password] is only needed if the file is protected.

BD - Main Database Operations
  BD SHOW                               : Display all rows in the main database
  BD CLEAN                              : Clear all data in the main database
  BD SORT <field> [type]                : Sort the main database by the specified column
                                           <type> = ASC | DESC | ALPHA | NUM
  Examples:
    BD SORT age ASC
    BD SORT name ALPHA
  Note: Sorting affects the main database permanently.

VIEW - Temporary Selection (does not affect main database)
  VIEW FILTER <condition>               : Select rows by a condition (e.g., age>30)
  VIEW SORT <field> [type]              : Sort the temporary selection
                                           <type> = ASC | DESC | ALPHA | NUM
  Examples:
    VIEW FILTER age>30
    VIEW SORT age DESC

COL - Table Column Operations
  COL ADD <name(TYPE[ARG]), ...>       : Add a new column with specified type and constraints
  COL EDIT <id> <name(TYPE[ARG])>      : Edit a column definition by ID
  COL DELETE <id>                      : Delete a column by ID
  Examples:
    COL ADD id(INT[X>0]),name(STRING[NONE]),age(INT[5<X<18])
    COL EDIT 2 age(INT[X<30])
  Note: You cannot edit columns if there are already rows in the database.

ROW - Table Row Operations
  ROW ADD <name=value, ...>            : Add a new row; unspecified fields = NONE
  ROW EDIT <id> <name=value>           : Edit a field in a row by ID
  ROW DELETE <id>                      : Delete a row by ID
  Examples:
    ROW ADD name=Alex,age=19,city=Moscow
    ROW ADD name=John                   -> other fields = NONE
    ROW EDIT 4 age=22

SERVICE COMMANDS
  HELP                                  : Display this help
  SAVE                                  : Save current state to memory
  LOAD                                  : Load the last saved state from memory
  EXIT                                  : Save the last version and exit the program

Notes:
- VIEW commands only affect the temporary selection, not the main database.
- BD SORT permanently changes the database order, unlike VIEW SORT.
